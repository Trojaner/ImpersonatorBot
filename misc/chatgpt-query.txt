Write a typescript class called RnnTextPredictor that does text prediction using a RNN with Tensorflow.js for Node.js. 
The text predictor will be trained with chat messages.

The RnnTextPredictor class should have at least the following functions:
- train: trains the model using data from a string array. It should train as fast as possible.
- predictRemainder: predicts the remainder of a given input message text
- predictRelated: predicts a related message to a given input message text
- generateRandom: generates a random text from the trained data as string array.
- export: exports and returns the model in a way that can be imported again
- import: imports a model that was exported using the generated export function

Only print code using markdown codeblocks. 
Include imports in the printed code. 
Do not make up any functions or packages.
Do not explain anything outside the code.
Do not create stub functions with only comments or nothing inside them.
