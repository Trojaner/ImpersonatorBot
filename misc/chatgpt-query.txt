Write a typescript class called RnnTextPredictor that does very accurate text prediction using a BiRNN with Tensorflow.js for Node.js and natural. 

First define a type called TextMessage. The TextMessage type contains two properties: content and time. 

The class should have the following functions:
- A function that trains the model using data from a TextMessage array
- A function that predicts the remainder of a given input message text
- A function that predicts a related message to a given input message text
- A function that generates a random text from the trained data as string array.
- A function that exports and returns the model in a way that can be imported again
- A function that imports a model that was exported using the generated export function

Only print code using markdown codeblocks. 
Include imports in the printed code. 
Do not explain anything outside the code.
Do not create stub functions with only comments or nothing inside them.
